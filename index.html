        <h1>Welcome to Rolling Through School</h1>

        <p>Hey there! We are a married veteran couple living full-time in a travel trailer while attending school. With
            our service dog, Liz, by our side, we want to experience freedom doing the RV lifestyle that lets us chase
            our goals, beautiful sunsets, and a place to settle in the future when it is time.</p>

        <h2>What you will find here:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>What it is like being student on the road</li>
            <li>Small-space cooking adventures</li>
            <li>Life with our service dog, Little Lizzy</li>
            <li>Travel stories, study tips, how to use your veteran benefits, and future plans</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This lifestyle has its challenges, but it's full of freedom, growth, and connection. We are just getting
            started and are very excited you are here for the ride.</p>

        <p>Liz totally runs the show &mdash; especially when snacks are involved.</p>
