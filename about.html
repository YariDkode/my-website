        <p>We are a married veteran couple navigating college life while living full-time in our Lance travel trailer. “Rolling Through School” is our way of sharing what it’s like to balance coursework, travel, and the everyday adventures that come with RV living.</p>

        <p>With our service dog, Liz, by our side, every day is a mix of learning and exploring. From quiet mornings studying by the mountains to long hikes on weekends, this journey is about chasing both our degrees and the freedom of the open road.</p>
