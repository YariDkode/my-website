# Rolling Through School

A personal website created for CIS155 that shares my journey as a full-time college student living in an RV with my husband and our service dog, Liz. The site includes stories, tips, and resources for traveling while in school.

## Peer Feedback & What I did

### From Elisabeth Jewett
1. **Jump to bottom link** — Elisabeth noted that the link to jump straight to the bottom of the homepage wasn’t really useful since it was already close to the bottom.  
   **What I did:** I removed the “Jump to bottom” link and the related text so the homepage looks cleaner.

2. **Lizzy’s image position** — She thought the small Lizzy image on the homepage felt oddly positioned and suggested adding other small images in a similar style.  
   **What I did:** I decided to keep Lizzy’s picture as-is because I like the current look, but I might add more similar images later.

3. **Add another header on About Us** — She suggested maybe adding another header like the “Our Story” header.  
   **What I did:** I decided to leave it as it is for now but may revisit this idea in the future.



### From Joshua Wolf
1. **Introduce everyone by name** — Joshua suggested introducing my husband and myself by name (or nickname) along with Liz.  
   **What I did:** I’m keeping it as it is for now but plan to add names later.

2. **Media query at 480px** — He pointed out the nav bar looks a little weird at 480px because it’s not flush with the top like other screen sizes.  
   **What I did:** Adjusted my CSS to improve spacing so it looks more consistent.

3. **Jump to bottom link reminder** — He also noticed the homepage still had the old “Jump to bottom” link from a previous assignment.  
   **What I did:** This was removed along with Elisabeth’s suggestion above.
